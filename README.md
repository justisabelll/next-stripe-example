# next stripe example

this repo is an example of different stripe payment implementations in next js

it aims to offer a solid foundation for integrating stripe payments in your next (app router) projects. code is minimal for easy adaptation, allowing space for your unique logic/product needs.

note that all of these examples are using the stripe checkout session api

## examples

in order to do any of the example implemenations you will need to have a stripe account and a stripe secret key. you can get one by signing up at [stripe](https://stripe.com/) and getting your secret key from the dashboard.
